# modular-esp32-sensor-hub-
Introduction:

This project is a modular ESP32-based sensor hub designed for rapid prototyping and monitoring environements. It supports a wide range of sensors through hot-swappable connectors, with onboard SD card logging, and runs off a 5v li-ion battery. The goal is to offer a deployable, plug-and-play embedded system thatâ€™s both scalable and user-friendly.

Primary Design Goals:

Modularity:hot-swappable sensor ports for analog, digital, and I2C devices, swapable power source, programable ESP board

Deployability:standalone and swapable power and onboard storage, light weight custom ESP 32 WROOM 32D board

Plug-and-play:Firmware pre installed and no user input required exept for conecting sensors to premaped sensor pins
